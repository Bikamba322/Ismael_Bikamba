		<p>Did you know poverty is the worst form of violence? – Mahatma Gandhi. Poverty is the one of the current issue that is threatening the world in a most dreadful way, and will haunt the upcoming generations if not solved properly. 689 million people are below the poverty line; this shows how the problem is evolving to become one of the biggest threat that the earth has faced in this modern era. This problem is something that should be considered a threat because it is responsible for many millions of deaths which it caused and its many other related issues. In order to eradicate the problem, we may need to use more approachable methods such as creating more employments and training individuals with skills that will help them to secure employments. The other solution we can use is to raise income per capita in order for the individuals to access most necessities using their income.</p>
